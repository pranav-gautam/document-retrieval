We have used machine learning to find the Wikipedia pages of people with similar names using a keyword. First we uploaded text data from Wikipedia, then we explored data using George Clooney and Barack Obama's names. Then we computed term frequency-inverse document frequency for the entire corpus of articles. Then we examined the TF-IDF for Obama and Clooney. We then manually evaluated the distance between certain people's articles. After this, we applied nearest neighbors for retrieval of Wikipedia articles. Then we compared the top words according to word counts to TF-IDF. And finally, we generalized the distance metric and built the nearest neighbor model.
